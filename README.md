# Pokemon Guess App

----

This is a simple Pokemon Guess app for starters. Created for people looking for basic app ideas.

You have 3 lives at the beginning. A new random Pokemon comes up to the screen and if you guess its name uncorrectly, your lives decrease.
If you spend all your lives, the game is over. You can try again, with the 'Retry' button at the end.

---- 

This app uses basic Kotlin Syntax for Android. Also includes a class for the Pokemon and multiple functions to apply basic OOP guidelines. 

It uses Constraint Layout with three types of Views which are: a Button, an ImageView and a TextInputLayout. This are accessed from the MainActivity.kt, with findViewById, to be used. 
The Pokemon is determined by the Random function and the corresponding image is shown on the ImageView.

The ImageView has a 'Content Description' to ensure the app is accessible.
